# Project-Neo-SF-3
This is the github repo for the Neo SF-3 group project for the class CS177 fall 2019. 

As of December 13th 2019, the project is complete and active development will cease (the semester is ending so not much after this). If you want to work on this project, feel free to fork and create a pull request. NOTE: You will need assets for the game which are linked in the dependencies below (Unless you wana use new free assets which that's cool too)

## Dependancies
### Free:
These are the free things we used in this project. You can download and use them freely in the game with no problem.
- Unity 2019.2.11f1
- Fungus - http://fungusgames.com/
This is for the cutscenes that are used

### Paid:
This is where it's tricky. We can't just release the project as is because we're using assets that are paid and we cant just push them to the project repository as is. We needed to remove them from the project. THere are the links to them.
- cInput - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/cinput-pro-3129
This is the Input manager we're using.
- Retro 2D Characters - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/retro-2d-characters-17847#content
For the player character sprites
- Ruined City - https://graphicriver.net/item/ruined-city-big-game-top-down-town-tileset/23118918
World environment sprites
